# UFO Sightings 
## Overview of Project: 
#### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project was to learn how to use the Javascript function to loop through the data to build the table and create a table to organize the information that will visually adjust 'events' change filtering and create customized filters with event listeners that record the information when an element has changed and develop an interactive webpage. Using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components to read Javascript code and create a webpage.

## Summary
#### 1, DrawBacks:
   ###### Unfortunately, the page has several drawbacks. Including
- The users must know specific cities, shapes, or dates. 
- The filters require correct spellings and the search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update if you do not enter exactly how data is stored.
- The data is limited and outdated since it is not connected to "live" sources.

#### 2, Recommendations for further  developments:
- The filter on a date might be preferable date range than put a single date because the UFO sightings occur every single day or may occur many times during the month.
- Adding the dropdown list or auto-fill that makes the page more attractive.
- Adding the updated and "Latest News" showing the most recent UFOs sightings.
